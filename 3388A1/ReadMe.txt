This program is made by Dhylan Usi.

This is an OpenGl program. This is made and ran on codeblock. 

This uses the function "glfwCreateWindow()" to create a window as a layout 

This program will keep rendering until the user decides to stop the program
for the function "glBegin()" that takes in "GL_TRIANGLES"
The color of the triangle is changed using "glColor3f()" with arguments "0.4f,0.3f,0.5f" 
to make a somewhat purply color.

This program terminates when the user closed the window and input any key from the keyboard

Along with this textfile, is a screenshot of the program running.
